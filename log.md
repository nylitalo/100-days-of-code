### Day 2: November 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Started today by redoing some parts of the project setup so that I have hot reloading and other amenities.
Planned out some of the key pages involved. tomorrow i will lay down some code.
**Thoughts:**:
So far so good. Even though I'm eager to get coding, I feel that having some sort of plan on what i need to do will help me down the road. I will not spend too much time planning, so I have decided that today was enough and I have what i need to get started.
