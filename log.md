### Day 2: November 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Started today by redoing some parts of the project setup so that I have hot reloading and other amenities.
Planned out some of the key pages involved. tomorrow i will lay down some code.
**Thoughts:**:
So far so good. Even though I'm eager to get coding, I feel that having some sort of plan on what i need to do will help me down the road. I will not spend too much time planning, so I have decided that today was enough and I have what i need to get started.

### Day 3: November 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
I have created the Home compenent.
I have created the Join Quiz component. For now it's a button that when pressed changes to a text input. It can take 5 characters and then the submot button appears.
As soon as there are quizzes to join I will make the button work :D
Next up is to create the NewQuiz compoenent.
**Thoughts:**:
So far so good. I feel that the ground work I did on day 2 is paying off. Already looking forward to tomorrows session.

### Day 5: November 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
implement functionallity for adding a question to the quiz and storing each individual questions state.
**Thoughts:**:
This was a fun challenge. Adding new objects to the quizzes array was no problem, but then updating the the objects key:value inside that array living in the state was a challenge that i eventually beat.
Still have some cleaning up to do, but will save that for breakfast.
